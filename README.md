The Vampire project has a [website](https://vprover.github.io)!

The website is hosted on GitHub pages, making some use of the Jekyll templating library.
Generally stuff is obvious: copy the style of whatever is there already, it's hard to break.

# New Members
It's nice to have you on the [team page](https://vprover.github.io/team.html)!
This is a simple process:
 - put a photo of yourself in `img/`: preferably a thumbnail, square aspect works best
 - add your name to `_includes/authors.html` - this allows you to have a short-form name and a hyperlink to your personal page if you like
 - add a section in `team.html` with a little about you and what you're doing - use the existing people's sections as inspiration

Push to master directly, we don't care that much. Welcome!

# News
Add a news item by copying a file in `_posts` and updating the file name and fields accordingly.
The list of news items will be updated automatically.
