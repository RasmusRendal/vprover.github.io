Automatic theorem proving has a number of important applications, such as Software Verification, Hardware Verification, 
Hardware Design, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Semantic Web, Algebra and Proving Theorems in Mathematics. 
Over 50 years of research in theorem proving have resulted in one of the most advanced and elegant theories in computer science.
This area is an ideal target for scientific engineering: implementation techniques have to be developed to realise an 
  advanced theory in practically valuable tools.

Vampire is a theorem prover, that is, a system able to prove theorems.
More precisely, it proves theorems in first-order logic. The development of Vampire began in 1994 and has survived a number of rewritings (see <a href="https://vprover.github.io/history.html">history</a>).

Here are a few facts about Vampire:
<ul>
  <li>Vampire is very fast, as can be judged by <a href="/trophies.html">our awards</a></li>
  <li>Vampire has a easy to use <i>portfolio mode</i> (see <a href="https://vprover.github.io/usage.html">Usage</a>) that can be run in multicore mode</li>
  <li>Vampire can "pretend to be an SMT solver" in the sense that it accepts SMT-LIB input and can effectively reason in combinations of first-order logic and theories, 
    such as integer arithmetic, which makes it useful for reasoning with theories and quantifiers</li>
  <li>Vampire can produce detailed proofs and finite models</li>
  <li>Vampire supports algebraic data types (finite term algebras)</li>
  <li>Vampire can generate interpolants</li>
</ul>
