<h2>Vampire</h2> <p>Automatic theorem proving has a number of important applications, such
        as Software Verification, Hardware Verification, Hardware Design,
        Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Semantic Web, Algebra and
        Proving Theorems in Mathematics.  Over 50 years of research in theorem
        proving have resulted in one of the most advanced and elegant theories
        in computer science. This area is an ideal target for scientific
        engineering: implementation techniques have to be developed to realise
        an advanced theory in practically valuable tools.</p> <p>Vampire is a theorem prover, that is, a system able to prove
         theorems. More precisely, it proves theorems in first-order
         logic. The development of Vampire has begun in 1994. 
<p>Vampire is very fast, as can be judged by  <a href="trophies.html">our awards</a>.</p></td></tr></table>
