<p>
Automatic theorem proving has a number of important applications, such as Software Verification, Hardware Verification, Hardware Design, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Semantic Web, Algebra and Proving Theorems in Mathematics.
Over 50 years of research in theorem proving have resulted in one of the most advanced and elegant theories in computer science.
This area is an ideal target for scientific engineering: implementation techniques have to be developed to realise an advanced theory in practically valuable tools.

Vampire is a theorem prover, that is, a system able to prove theorems.
More precisely, it proves theorems in first-order logic. The development of Vampire has begun in 1994.
