<p>
Our licence is quite liberal.
In short, we do not allow modification and distribution of Vampire and the use of Vampire to compete against Vampire.
To obtain a copy of Vampire you will be required to accept the terms of the licence.
If you require any other licence, please contact {{ voronkov }} and {{ reger }}.
</p> 

<p>
It should be noted that some software included with Vampire is available under a more permisive licence.
For example, both <a href="https://github.com/niklasso/minisat">minisat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">z3</a> are used internally by Vampire.
