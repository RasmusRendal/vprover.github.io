<td class="content"> <h1>Vampire Licence</h1> <p>Our licence is quite liberal. In short, we do not allow
         modification and distribution of Vampire and the use of
         Vampire to compete against Vampire. To obtain a copy
         of Vampire you will be required to accept the terms of the
         licence. If you require any other licence, please contact
         <a href="http://www.voronkov.com/">Andrei Voronkov</a>.</p><br> 

<p>It should be noted that some software included with Vampire is available under a more permisive licence. For example, both <a href="https://github.com/niklasso/minisat">minisat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">z3</a> are used internally by Vampire.<p><br>
