<p>
Vampire is winning at least one division of the world cup in theorem proving CASC since 1999.
All together Vampire won 30 titles: more than any other prover.
We traditionally take part in the following two divisions of the competition:
<ol>
 <li>
The FOF division: unrestricted first-order problems.
This division was ranked second in importance after the MIX division before 2007 and is now recognised as the main competition division.
 <li>
The CNF division: first-order problems in conjunctive normal form.
This division was called MIX and recognised as the main competition division before 2007.
 <li>
The LTB division: problems with very large axiomatisations (some of them contain about 3.5 million axioms).
</ol>

Here is the list of our achievements:
