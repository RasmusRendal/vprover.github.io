<p>
Vampire has won at least one division of the world cup in theorem proving CASC since 1999.
All together Vampire won 45 titles: more than any other prover.
We take part in the following divisions of the competition:
</p>

<ol>
 <li>
The FOF division: first-order theorems.  
This division was ranked second in importance after the MIX division before 2007 and is now recognised as the main competition division.
 <li>
The CNF division: first-order problems in conjunctive normal form.
This division was called MIX and recognised as the main competition division before 2007.
 <li>
The LTB division: problems with very large axiomatisations (some of them contain about 3.5 million axioms).
<li>
The EPR division: problems that fall within the Effectively Propositional fragment. We entered this track for the first time in 2015. The track is traditionally won by <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~korovink/iprover/">iProver</a>
<li>
The FNT division: first-order non-theorems. We entered this track for the first time in 2015. Our success is supported heavily by our implementation of finite model building.
<li>
The TFA division: typed first-order theorems with arithmetic. We entered this track for the first time in 2015. Such problems are typically the domain of SMT solvers.
<li>
The SLH division: typed first-order theorems without arithmetic generated by Sledgehammer. This division has a much shorter time limit and is designed to reflect the Sledgehammer use case.
</ol>

<p>
Note: winner* means that Vampire solved more problems that all other provers in this division (this has not been computed post 2013) and '-' means that the division did not exist that year. Tracks EPR, FNT, and TFA were entered for the first time in 2015. Track SLH only ran in 2017. 
</p>

<h2>SMTCOMP</h2>
<p>
Since 2016 we have also entered SMTCOMP.
We performed well both years (full details will be added here soon).
You can view the results for <a href="http://smtcomp.sourceforge.net/2016/results-summary.shtml?v=1467876482">2016</a> and <a href="http://smtcomp.sourceforge.net/2017/results-summary.shtml?v=1500632282">2017</a> directly.
Vampire competed in all tracks with quantifiers and without bitvectors or floating point.
