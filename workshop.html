<p>
We are pleased to announce that the 7th Vampire workshop will be affiliated with <a href="https://easyconferences.eu/cade2023/">CADE 2023</a> in Rome!
</p>

<p>
The Vampire workshop discusses recent developments in implementation, application, evaluation and comparison of first-order theorem provers, including but not limited to Vampire, and their interaction with other systems.
Participants include Vampire developers and users, and the workshop provides a venue for discussion between the two groups.
Both groups can learn more about Vampireâ€™s recent developments, possible applications of Vampire, its efficiency in various settings, and the needs of users.
</p>

<p>
The workshop sheds light on topics such as:
<ul>
<li> prerequisites for substantial progress in theorem proving tools
<li> implementation principles and practice
<li> heuristics and strategies for different application areas
<li> case studies, successful and unsuccessful
<li> missing features in modern theorem provers
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
To be decided.
